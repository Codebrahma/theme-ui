# Typography

This page uses themes from Typography.js to populate the `theme` object.
It's not currently a 1:1 replacement for all styles provided by Typography.js,
but is a demonstration of how it could fit in with the rest of Theme UI for users who
want to take advantage of Typography.js.
Typography style themes that are completely decoupled from Typography.js could also be supported in a similar way.

## Usage

```sh
npm i theme-ui-typography
```

There are two methods for integrating Typography.js with Theme UI.

1. The first method uses the `toTheme` function to create a base `theme` object based on Typography.js options or themes and uses a default, static `theme.styles` object to pick up values from the base theme.
2. The other method uses the `toStyles` function to add hard-coded styles to the `theme.styles` object without affecting the base theme object.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import { toTheme } from 'theme-ui-typography'
import wp2016 from 'typography-theme-wordpress-2016'

const theme = toTheme(wp2016)

export default props =>
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
```
